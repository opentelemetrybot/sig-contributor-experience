# GitHub Workflow Permissions Compliance Report

## Overview
This report documents the compliance status of all GitHub workflow files in the repository with OpenSSF Scorecard token permissions requirements.

## Files Analyzed
- `.github/workflows/ossf-scorecard.yml`

## Compliance Summary

### ✅ Root-Level Permissions
The workflow file has proper root-level permissions:
```yaml
permissions: read-all
```

This meets the requirement for limiting root-level permissions to either `read-all` or `contents: read`.

### ✅ Job-Level Permissions
The `analysis` job has appropriate job-level permissions:
```yaml
permissions:
  # Needed for Code scanning upload
  security-events: write
  # Needed for GitHub OIDC token if publish_results is true
  id-token: write
```

These permissions are necessary for:
- `security-events: write` - Required for uploading SARIF results to GitHub's code scanning dashboard
- `id-token: write` - Required for GitHub OIDC token when `publish_results` is true

### ✅ Formatting Compliance
The file follows proper formatting rules with blank lines above and below the permissions block.

## Conclusion
**All workflow files are fully compliant with OpenSSF Scorecard token permissions requirements.**

No changes are needed to meet the security requirements outlined in the issue.
